## 🧐 The Problem
"Shrinkflation" is the practice of reducing the size or quantity of a product while the price remains the same or slightly increases. It is often invisible to the average consumer.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To build an automated data pipeline that tracks specific product SKUs across major e-commerce platforms to detect:
1. Changes in **Net Weight/Volume**.
2. Changes in **Price**.
3. Calculations of **Price-Per-Gram** over time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)
* **Data Ingestion:** Python (`requests`, `BeautifulSoup`)
* **Data Storage:** CSV / SQL (TBD)
* **Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib / PowerBI

## 📂 Architecture

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Define target product list (FMCG focus)
- [ ] Build initial scraper for Site A
